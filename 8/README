Shell script to make a thumbnail from a completed Scrabulous game 
stored in the SQLite3 database /tmp/scrabgames.db

Outputs a 128x128 PNG suitable for uploading to Tumblr, etc.

Requires a text file named blankboard which contains the list of
filenames required for montage to create the full-sized blank board.

The script iterates over the nodes, placing each letter into the 
new list of images (newboard) using an ed script.  montage creates
the full-sized image and convert scales it down to our thumbnail.
